Starting from the navbar you created in the HTML exercise called 'Navbar', add the CSS properties. The Search button should have a hover effect (background green and white text).

**Suggestion**:
Use the classes to apply the CSS rules instead of ids, tags, or inline style.


**Exercise 9**
Make responsive the exercise 'Nav': below 768 pixels the navbar is replaced by an hamburger menu without functionalities, it just appears. Try to create the hamburger menu both with CSS rules and using an icon.
